# data-in-map

A single page application developed to visually display data on Child Labor in Brazil.

This application uses data from [Radar SIT](https://sit.trabalho.gov.br/radar/), a government body that is responsible for labor-related inspections.

The data was splitted into categories, each one with a complementar graph to help the visualization of the data.
